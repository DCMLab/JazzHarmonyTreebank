Corvocado : OK 


'How High The Moon' : I-V open constituent


'You Stepped Out Of A Dream': Deep I-V open constituent

I get why it's drawn as it is, but to me it feels weird connecting the Db7
to Eb rather than C


"This Can't Be Love" : I-V open constituent in first A

Different from the Fakebook transscription - not so easy to check for me

'Take The A Train' : 

Should maybe actually be a I-V constituent if the first A turnaround is
included in the tree? (G7 treelet at 0100) That turnaround is omitted e.g.
in the fakebook (it does have a Db9 going back to the C starting the final
A part).

'Just In Time' : I-II open constituent(?)

Why are some Gm in treelet at 100 part of their own tree, while one is
hanging off the top C7? "Tonicization" vs preparation?


'Just Friends' : I-V open constituent

Again transcriptions differ. In the real book, the G7 at 10000 is a Db7
(movement by semitone vs by fifth). Also, the F#%7 at 11000100 is omitted.

'Jersey Bounce' : Strangely _not_ a I-V open constituent?

** 'Corvocado' : 

OK 

** 'How High The Moon' : I-V open :constituent:


** 'You Stepped Out Of A Dream': Deep I-V open :constituent:

I get why it's drawn as it is, but to me it feels weird connecting the Db7
to Eb rather than C

Db as voice leading constituent between C and Eb

** 'This Can't Be Love' :TODO check it!: I-V open :constituent: in first A

Different from the Fakebook transscription - not so easy to check for me

** 'Take The A Train' : 

Should maybe actually be a I-V :constituent: if the first A turnaround is
included in the tree? (G7 treelet at 0100) That turnaround is omitted e.g.
in the fakebook (it does have a Db9 going back to the C starting the final
A part).

** 'Just In Time' : I-bVII open :constituent:(?)

Why are some Gm in treelet at 100 part of their own tree, while one is
hanging off the top C7? "Tonicization" vs preparation?
C#o7 prep for Bb6

Bb6 is a "low tonic" problem? Should be looked at for future developments
of theory - see also The Preacher. 

** 'Just Friends' : I-V open :constituent:

Again transcriptions differ. In the real book, the G7 at 10000 is a Db7
(movement by semitone vs by fifth). Also, the F#%7 at 11000100 is omitted.

** 'Jersey Bounce' : Strangely _not_ a I-V open :constituent:?

After discussion with Daniel - this _should_ be a I-V open constituent in
the first A-part, meaning the Abo7 and Gm7 at 01000 and 010010 respectively
should form the right-most part of the subtree at 00

** 'I'll Close My Eyes' : I-V open :constituent:

It's not obvious to me what part of the turnaround/half cadence should end
up on which side of the tree (especially since the transcription I find has
a Abo7 instead of the D7, and a Gb7/C instead of a C7 - but that's
basically the same..). After some thought and discussion with Daniel, it is
either fine as it is, or it is possbly a very long turnaround.

** 'I Can't Give You Anything But Love' : i-V open :constituent:s en masse

The question here is, again whether these are half cadences or turnarounds.
Not an easy decision.

** 'I Can't Believe...You're In Love...' : TODO-Check

Another one I can't find a lead sheet or recording of right away.

** 'Hackensack' : OK

** 'Fine Romance, A' : I-V open :constituent:

I'm not sure if the second chord is a preparation of the third (as
written), or a prolongation of the first (similar for the fourth, and also
in the repeat ofc), but this depends a bit on how you feel the phrasing in
the melody. 

** 'Donna Lee' : I-V open :constituent:

Again it's, to me, ambiguous how the phrasing should work. I could the
final two chords of the A part more as a turnaround (upbeat) rather than a
half cadence, which would still leave us with a I-II open constituent.

We could also view the initial chord of the B part as "two chords", one the
final I of the A part, and one the first I of the B part.

We should include a comment about this ambiguity in the tree.

Christoph has a concern about the Ab in the middle-ish of the first part.

Apart from that the chords also differ between transcriptions. In the Real
Book I, I have an Ab as the first chord of the last four bars (it's a Cm in
the tree), which - I would argue - does not necessarily prepare the
following F7, but rather serves as a prolongation of the final tonic.

** 'Day By Day' : I-V open :constituent:?

The tune is ultimately in G, but plays around to such a degree in A dorian
that it almost acts as a secondary tonic, especially around the move
between A and B - specifically, I read the annotation of the A7-E7 treelet
that spans the A part as a "II-VI" (or (I-V)/ii) open constituent. 

Listening to various recordings this is handled differently - In the slow
version with Sinatra, the half cadence is actually on D (so in the main
key), while other versions maybe don't do as much of it in the first place.

This is an exemplar of an "evaded half cadence", where we go from VI to
V/V to ii and then (not) to V, but rather to ii-V in A to get back to the
beginning of the next phrase.

This is a good candidate for including two different trees, as there are
disagreements about whether or not the first G is a tonic tonic or more
part of a falling fifth 

I might also include the last Am7 of part A as part of the left-hand
treelet, but this is a separate issue.

** 'Dancing in the Dark : I-V open :constituent:

No transcription, I don't know the tune

** 'Candy'

Pretty straightforward, though one may quibble about the exact way the A
phrase is broken down hierarchically - I personally don't understand why
the Eb is privileged as preparing the Bb rather than part of the general
chromatic descending pattern down to Cm, but this may be something that is
clearer with explanation.

Eb^7 -> F

Ebm6 is subordinate to that, and goes (maybe?) to Dm7

** 'Beautiful Love' : I-V open :constituent:

Again a quibble - where does the first Bb7's go in the tree? I feel that it
is more like a prolongation with the Gm rather than a preparation of the
penultimate A7.

** 'Baubles, Bangles And Beads'

I wonder if it would make sense to restructure the subtree at 1001 to
make it more similar to the what goes on in the first A part. Something
like

[.$Ab$ [.$Ebm7$ [.$Bbm7$ [.$F7$ [.$F7$ [.$F7$ [.$Ebm7$ $Bbm7$ $Ebm7$ ] [.$F7$ $Cm7$ $F7$ ] ] ] [.$F7$ [.$Ebm7$ $Bbm7$ $Ebm7$ ] [.$F7$ [.$F7$ $Gb$ $F7$ ] ] ] ] $Bbm7$ ] $Ebm7$ ] $Ab$ ]

which uses open constituents.

Discussions were not necessarily conclusive.

Two versions of the tree may be a good idea.

** THIS IS HOW FAR WE GOT 2020-04-03

** 'Zingaro (Retrato Em Branco E Preto)' Open I-V :constituent:

I don't know the tune, can't say anything more..

** 'Why Do I Love You?' I-V open :constituent:s (four of them)

OK, I think.

** 'Time On My Hands'

OK, as far as I can tell

** 'Them There Eyes' I-V open :constituent:

Might instead be a I-ii open constituent if we move the treelet rooted at
the Bb7 at 010000 to be the head of the Ab tree at 00 (aligning with the
way things are arranged in the B part). This may definitely make things
more complex though, and requires "open predominants".

** 'Stella by Starlight'

OK

** 'So Nice (Summer Samba)' I-V open :constituent:

Apart from that mostly OK. Do you see Eb7 as preparing or prolonging the
C7?

** 'Remember'

OK

** 'Nuages' I-V open :constituent:

OK otherwise.

** 'My Melancholy Baby' Open I-V :constituent:

Looks OK, but I can't necessarily match the chords to the tune

** 'Look For The Silver Lining' Open I-V :constituent:

LGTM

** 'In A Little Spanish Town'

I'm not sure about the next to last Gmaj7 - I think that's already the
final tonic rather than a preparation for the D7. I guess this is a prime
example of the "low tonic" problem?

** 'I Love You' Open I-III :constituent:?

The rest looks good to me.

** 'I Love Paris'

LGTM

** 'Good Life, The' I-V open :constituent:

I may want to see the half-way Abmaj7's (0100000 and 110000) as
prolongations of the tonic (maybe tricky in the left subtree, though)
rather than preparations of the G%7. I agree that it is not, as such,
superior to the initial tonic, but I wonder if you could arrange it as
[.$Ab6$ [.$Eb7$ [.$Ab^7$ $Ab^7$ $Ab^7$ ] [.$Eb7$ [.$Ab^7$ [.$Gb7$ [.$G7$ [.$Fm7$ [.$C7$ $Gm7$ $C7$ ] [.$Fm7$ $Fm7$ $Fm7$ ] ] [.$G7$ $D%7$ $G7$ ] ] [.$Gb7$ $Db^7$ $Gb7$ ] ] $Ab^7$ ] [.$Eb7$ [.$Bbm7$ [.$Bb7$ [.$Fm7$ [.$C7$ $G%7$ $C7$ ] $Fm7$ ] $Bb7$ ] $Bbm7$ ] $Eb7$ ] ] ] [.$Ab6$ [.$Ab^7$ $Ab^7$ $Ab^7$ ] [.$Ab6$ [.$Ab^7$ [.$Gb7$ [.$G7$ [.$Fm7$ [.$C7$ $Gm7$ $C7$ ] [.$Fm7$ $Fm7$ $Fm7$ ] ] [.$G7$ $D%7$ $G7$ ] ] [.$Gb7$ $Db^7$ $Gb7$ ] ] $Ab^7$ ] [.$Ab6$ [.$Eb7$ [.$Bbm7$ $F7$ $Bbm7$ ] [.$Eb7$ $Ebsus$ $Eb7$ ] ] $Ab6$ ] ] ] ]

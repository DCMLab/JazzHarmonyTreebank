** 'You Stepped Out Of A Dream': Deep I-V open :constituent:

I get why it's drawn as it is, but to me it feels weird connecting the Db7
to Eb rather than C

Db as voice leading constituent between C and Eb

DONE (open constituent annotated)

** 'This Can't Be Love' : I-V open :constituent: in first A

DONE

Different from the Fakebook transscription - not so easy to check for me

** 'Take The A Train' : 

Should maybe actually be a I-V :constituent: if the first A turnaround is
included in the tree? (G7 treelet at 0100) That turnaround is omitted e.g.
in the fakebook (it does have a Db9 going back to the C starting the final
A part).

DONE (not changed)

** 'Just In Time' : I-bVII open :constituent:(?)

Why are some Gm in treelet at 100 part of their own tree, while one is
hanging off the top C7? "Tonicization" vs preparation?
C#o7 prep for Bb6

Bb6 is a "low tonic" problem? Should be looked at for future developments
of theory - see also The Preacher. 

DONE (comment about Bb6 in measure 21 added, annotate open constituent)

** 'Just Friends' : I-V open :constituent:

Again transcriptions differ. In the real book, the G7 at 10000 is a Db7
(movement by semitone vs by fifth). Also, the F#%7 at 11000100 is omitted.

DONE (annotate open constituent)

** 'Jersey Bounce' : Strangely _not_ a I-V open :constituent:?

After discussion with Daniel - this _should_ be a I-V open constituent in
the first A-part, meaning the Abo7 and Gm7 at 01000 and 010010 respectively
should form the right-most part of the subtree at 00

DONE (tree corrected using the discussed open constituent)

** 'I'll Close My Eyes' : I-V open :constituent:

It's not obvious to me what part of the turnaround/half cadence should end
up on which side of the tree (especially since the transcription I find has
a Abo7 instead of the D7, and a Gb7/C instead of a C7 - but that's
basically the same..). After some thought and discussion with Daniel, it is
either fine as it is, or it is possbly a very long turnaround.

DONE (open constituent annotated)

** 'I Can't Give You Anything But Love' : i-V open :constituent:s en masse

The question here is, again whether these are half cadences or turnarounds.
Not an easy decision.

EXCLUDED FOR NOW (because of the idiomatic cadential ending thing)

** 'I Can't Believe...You're In Love...' : Check

Another one I can't find a lead sheet or recording of right away.

DONE

** 'Hackensack' : OK

DONE

** 'Fine Romance, A' : I-V open :constituent:

I'm not sure if the second chord is a preparation of the third (as
written), or a prolongation of the first (similar for the fourth, and also
in the repeat ofc), but this depends a bit on how you feel the phrasing in
the melody. 

DONE (open constituent annotated)

** 'Donna Lee' : I-V open :constituent:

Again it's, to me, ambiguous how the phrasing should work. I could the
final two chords of the A part more as a turnaround (upbeat) rather than a
half cadence, which would still leave us with a I-II open constituent.

We could also view the initial chord of the B part as "two chords", one the
final I of the A part, and one the first I of the B part.

We should include a comment about this ambiguity in the tree.

Christoph has a concern about the Ab in the middle-ish of the first part.

Apart from that the chords also differ between transcriptions. In the Real
Book I, I have an Ab as the first chord of the last four bars (it's a Cm in
the tree), which - I would argue - does not necessarily prepare the
following F7, but rather serves as a prolongation of the final tonic.

TODO

** 'Day By Day' : I-V open :constituent:?

The tune is ultimately in G, but plays around to such a degree in A dorian
that it almost acts as a secondary tonic, especially around the move
between A and B - specifically, I read the annotation of the A7-E7 treelet
that spans the A part as a "II-VI" (or (I-V)/ii) open constituent. 

Listening to various recordings this is handled differently - In the slow
version with Sinatra, the half cadence is actually on D (so in the main
key), while other versions maybe don't do as much of it in the first place.

This is an exemplar of an "evaded half cadence", where we go from VI to
V/V to ii and then (not) to V, but rather to ii-V in A to get back to the
beginning of the next phrase.

This is a good candidate for including two different trees, as there are
disagreements about whether or not the first G is a tonic tonic or more
part of a falling fifth 

I might also include the last Am7 of part A as part of the left-hand
treelet, but this is a separate issue.

TODO

** 'Dancing in the Dark : I-V open :constituent:

No transcription, I don't know the tune

DONE

** 'Candy'

Pretty straightforward, though one may quibble about the exact way the A
phrase is broken down hierarchically - I personally don't understand why
the Eb is privileged as preparing the Bb rather than part of the general
chromatic descending pattern down to Cm, but this may be something that is
clearer with explanation.

Eb^7 -> F

Ebm6 is subordinate to that, and goes (maybe?) to Dm7

DONE

** 'Beautiful Love' : I-V open :constituent:

Again a quibble - where does the first Bb7's go in the tree? I feel that it
is more like a prolongation with the Gm rather than a preparation of the
penultimate A7.

DONE

** 'Baubles, Bangles And Beads'

I wonder if it would make sense to restructure the subtree at 1001 to
make it more similar to the what goes on in the first A part. Something
like

[.$Ab$ [.$Ebm7$ [.$Bbm7$ [.$F7$ [.$F7$ [.$F7$ [.$Ebm7$ $Bbm7$ $Ebm7$ ] [.$F7$ $Cm7$ $F7$ ] ] ] [.$F7$ [.$Ebm7$ $Bbm7$ $Ebm7$ ] [.$F7$ [.$F7$ $Gb$ $F7$ ] ] ] ] $Bbm7$ ] $Ebm7$ ] $Ab$ ]

which uses open constituents.

Discussions were not necessarily conclusive.

Two versions of the tree may be a good idea.

DONE (original tree used)

** THIS IS HOW FAR WE GOT 2020-04-03

** 'Zingaro (Retrato Em Branco E Preto)' Open I-V :constituent:

I don't know the tune, can't say anything more..

The discussion centered around the relationship between the Bb and A (Bb
should be a prolonged tonic). This was decided that it was.

Also, what is the D7-E connection, if any?

Christoph argues that the tonicization/modulation to Eb breaks the
connection between the D7 and the rest of it, while Daniel hears the D7 and
F minor as a change of color (i.e. a double preparation of E^7 or a
prolongation of Fm7). 

Solution: Either one tree, the other tree, or both. (Flip a coin.. Daniel
wins)

TODO: 
  * Bb7 is a tonic (prolongation of the first tonic)
  * Mark the half cadence
  * Add comment about the discussion about D7

** 'Why Do I Love You?' I-V open :constituent:s (four of them)

OK, I think.

TODO:
 * Mark half open constituents

** 'Time On My Hands'

WRONG: OK, as far as I can tell

TODO: Move the second F to the next subtree - leave a I-V constituent in
the beginning

 Double preparation by or prolongation of the Gm7 in bar 5 and at the end of
 the B part into the V ending the B part.





** 'Them There Eyes' I-V open :constituent:

Might instead be a I-ii open constituent if we move the treelet rooted at
the Bb7 at 010000 to be the head of the Ab tree at 00 (aligning with the
way things are arranged in the B part). This may definitely make things
more complex though, and requires "open predominants".

TODO: 

 * Mark open constituent
 * Move the two Eb7 in the first subtree to be on the same level.
 * (Maybe move the Bb before that to the end of the previous)
 * Note Helge pattern/schema around the Ddim ("low tonic")

** 'Stella by Starlight'

OK

TODO:
 * Connect the F^7 to the Dm7 as a prolongation

** 'So Nice (Summer Samba)' I-V open :constituent:

Apart from that mostly OK. Do you see Eb7 as preparing or prolonging the
C7?

TODO
 * Mark open constituent
 * ((((Maybe mark the Eb7 as also preparing the final F6 (?)))))
 * Bind the I-bVII together which then connects to the V, making an open
   I-V constituent, and do the related changes to the second subtree

** 'Remember'

OK

A question about the Gb7/C7 constituent: Is that a an "open V-V
constituent", or is it a prolongation?

** 'Nuages' I-V open :constituent:

OK otherwise.

TODO:
 * Mark open constituent
 * Move the next to final G6 to be a prolongation of the first tonic
   of the B part
 * Bbm6 -> Eb7 

** 'My Melancholy Baby' Open I-V :constituent:

Looks OK, but I can't necessarily match the chords to the tune

TODO:
 * Mark open constituent
 * Another Helge! (Bb7 -> Bb?)
 * (We had a long discussion here about the Helge, and the tonic with the 5
    in the bass functions as a cadential 6-4, which can be resolved to
    either the dominant directly or to the)

** 'Look For The Silver Lining' Open I-V :constituent:

LGTM

TODO:
 * Mark open constituent

** 'In A Little Spanish Town'

I'm not sure about the next to last Gmaj7 - I think that's already the
final tonic rather than a preparation for the D7. I guess this is a prime
example of the "low tonic" problem?

TODO:
 * Check the final low tonic thing (is it a Helge?)
 * Bb in measure 10 is a pasing chord to Am7

** 'I Love You' Open I-III :constituent:?

The rest looks good to me.
Add to comment field: A major chord chould also be a hexatonic contrast to  the global tonic.

TODO:
 * Open constituent?
 * "Blurry harmony"

** 'I Love Paris'

LGTM

** 'Good Life, The' I-V open :constituent:

I may want to see the half-way Abmaj7's (0100000 and 110000) as
prolongations of the tonic (maybe tricky in the left subtree, though)
rather than preparations of the G%7. I agree that it is not, as such,
superior to the initial tonic, but I wonder if you could arrange it as
[.$Ab6$ [.$Eb7$ [.$Ab^7$ $Ab^7$ $Ab^7$ ] [.$Eb7$ [.$Ab^7$ [.$Gb7$ [.$G7$ [.$Fm7$ [.$C7$ $Gm7$ $C7$ ] [.$Fm7$ $Fm7$ $Fm7$ ] ] [.$G7$ $D%7$ $G7$ ] ] [.$Gb7$ $Db^7$ $Gb7$ ] ] $Ab^7$ ] [.$Eb7$ [.$Bbm7$ [.$Bb7$ [.$Fm7$ [.$C7$ $G%7$ $C7$ ] $Fm7$ ] $Bb7$ ] $Bbm7$ ] $Eb7$ ] ] ] [.$Ab6$ [.$Ab^7$ $Ab^7$ $Ab^7$ ] [.$Ab6$ [.$Ab^7$ [.$Gb7$ [.$G7$ [.$Fm7$ [.$C7$ $Gm7$ $C7$ ] [.$Fm7$ $Fm7$ $Fm7$ ] ] [.$G7$ $D%7$ $G7$ ] ] [.$Gb7$ $Db^7$ $Gb7$ ] ] $Ab^7$ ] [.$Ab6$ [.$Eb7$ [.$Bbm7$ $F7$ $Bbm7$ ] [.$Eb7$ $Ebsus$ $Eb7$ ] ] $Ab6$ ] ] ] ] 

Saved for next time

** 'Dearly Beloved'

The lead sheet in the first Real Book looks similar but not exact, but
definitely seems to imply an open I-bII constituent or so. At least, it
doesn't seem convincing to me to land the first phrase at the second Cmaj7,
which to me feels more preparatory for the turnaround to Dm7.

** 'Broadway'

LGTM

'Blue Lou'

Looks mostly good - the only concern I would have would be with the
tree structure in the B part. Arguably the first phrase is an open
constituent rather than something with a turnaround, but this is a quibble.

** 'Bill Bailey' :helge:

Very clear Helge schema, but good overall.

** '502 Blues'

I don't agree with privileging the Am at the start of the phrases. I hear
those very much landing in the E7, which in the realbook is notated as
E7#9, which I think is better understood as a E major/minor thing than a
spiced up dominant in this case. So I would put those essentially as
prolongations all of the same top-level E. The tree then becomes:
[.$Em7"$ [.$E^7$ [.$E7$ [.$E7$ [.$B%7$ [.$Db^7$ $Am7$ $Db^7$ ] $B%7$ ] $E7$ ] [.$E7$ [.$B%7$ [.$Db^7$ $Am7$ $Db^7$ ] $B%7$ ] $E7$ ] ] [.$E^7$ [.$E^7$ [.$B7$ [.$Bb^7$ [.$F7$ $Cm7$ $F7$ ] $Bb^7$ ] [.$B7$ [.$F#%7$ [.$Db7$ $Abm7$ $Db7$ ] $F#%7$ ] $B7$ ] ] $E^7$ ] $E^7$ ] ] [.$Em7"$ [.$E7$ [.$E7$ [.$B%7$ [.$Db^7$ [.$Am7$ $E7$ $Am7$ ] $Db^7$ ] $B%7$ ] $E7$ ] [.$E7$ [.$B%7$ [.$Db^7$ [.$Am7$ $Am7$ ] $Db^7$ ] $B%7$ ] $E7$ ] ] [.$Em7"$ [.$Em7$ [.$B7$ [.$Bb^7$ [.$F7$ $Cm7$ $F7$ ] $Bb^7$ ] [.$B7$ [.$F#%7$ [.$Db7$ $Abm7$ $Db7$ ] $F#%7$ ] $B7$ ] ] $Em7$ ] $Em7"$ ] ] ]

** 'Weaver Of Dreams, A' Open :constituent:

Looks good - it has an open constituent, and one may quibble if it's I-II
or I-V, but I'm definitely OK with the current version.

** "Struttin' With Some Barbecue" Open :constituent:

(I found this mostly in other keys - any mistakes are mine). The open I-V
constituent is clear as day. I would rather connect the subtree at 010 (C7)
to prepare the C#o7 rather than to be on the same level as the final V.
Apart from this it looks good!

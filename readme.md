# Jazz Harmony Treebank

This repo contains the iRealPro chord sequences including tree annotations.

The treebank is available in the file `treebank.json`, structured as a
JSON with the following fields:

 * `title`: The title of the piece
 * `measures`: A monotonically increasing list of integers indicating the
    measures in the piece. Some measures appear more than once, indicating
    that more than one chord appears in it.
 * `beats`: A list of the beats where the chords appear. This list will be
    the same length as the `measures` list. There is at least a
    `1` item for each measure, denoting what chord is played on the
    downbeat. Additional entries are integers that indicate on what beat
    subsequent chords within the same measure start at. In a standard 4/4
    measure with two chords, the list could contain, for example `[1,3]` to
    indicate that the second chord comes in at beat 3.
 * `chords`: The list of chords. The length of this list will be the same
   as the `measures` and `beats` lists. Chords are strings composed of 
   * a fundamental (an uppercase letter A-G optionally with a `#` or `b` to
     indicate accidentals).
   * For minor chords a lowercase `m`, for augmented chords a `+`, and for
     sus chords a `sus`. Chords with no extra text here are major.
   * An optional `6`, `7` or `^7` indicating an added sixth, minor, or
     major sevenths, respectively.
 * `turnaround`: An integer that indicates which chord in the sequence is
   the true final chord of the tune. If the number is `0`, then this
   coincides with the final chord of the `chords` list. A positive value of
   `2` indicates that the third last chord is the tonic, while the last two
   chords constitute a turnaround to bring the tune back to the beginning
   for repeated choruses. A negative number of `-2` indicates that the tune
   should be repeated and end on the second chord from the beginning of the
   `chords` list to end properly.
 * `open_constituent_tree` and `complete_constituent_tree` both contain
   harmonic tree analyses of the full harmonic sequence, as ended at the
   chord indicated by the `turnaround`. The difference between the two
   trees is further described in the paper, but briefly constitutes whether
   or not the tree is a strict (`complete`) dependency structure, or
   whether some (`open`) constituents have multiple subconstituents all
   referring to some future chord. The trees are JSON objects recursively
   defined as having a `label` (which is a chord taken from the `chords`
   list), and a list `children` of either zero or two subtrees, which are
   themselves trees.
 * `comments`: A string containing any comments from the annotation
   procedure, for example noting alternate chord sequences from other
   sources, fixed transcription errors, ambiguities chord roles etc.
 * `composers`: A string with the name(s) of the composer(s) of the tune
 * `year`: An integer representation of the year (CE) the tune was composed
    ***(published?)***
 * `meter`: A JSON object containing two integers, `numerator` and
   `denominator` indicating the meter of the piece.
 * `key`: The key as annotated in the iRealPro corpus. (DO WE WANT TO KEEP
   THIS?). This is an uppercase (for major keys) or lowercase (for minor
     keys) letter between a-g, possibly followed by a `-` to indicate a
   lowering accidental.
 * `keys`: TODO: do we want to keep this? I don't know what it is.

* Pieces [15/25]

** DONE Red Clay [OK]

** TODO Solar [OK]                                                  :discuss:

- alternative option: prep F Db, prep Db C, prep G C
  - feels like a double preparation, not prol Db G, but prep F Db is weird

** DONE Birk's Works [OK]

- blues IV problem
- transcription questionable, but not significantly

** DONE Blue in Green [OK]

- transcription a bit weird: chorus + ending

** TODO Booker's Waltz [?]                                          :discuss:

- would attach Eb7 higher
  - preparing Fm7 or
  - preparing Ab
- rest ok

** DONE Contemplation [OK]

** TODO Friday the 13th [?]                                         :discuss:

- here turnaround as I-V, in other cases (Solar) missing I added
- would prefer double preparation F7 and D7
  - but prol also ok

** TODO If you never come to me [?]                                 :discuss:

- improvement: Dm7 - Fm7 as double prep
  - Dm7 prepares G7 -> subst by Bb7 -> prepared again by Fm7
- disagree: Bb7 - E7 is interruption, Bb7 is global D, E7 is applied
  - either double prep of C (from Bb7 and G7)
  - or prol Bb7 G7
- alternative: G7 (and possibly Bb7) prepare final Cmaj7
  - C7 is applied to F, but otherwise detached
  - reason: G7 sounds like global dominant, should prepare global tonic
    - G7 C7 is nice surface trick, but more like interruption
- alternative: Bbmaj7 does not prepare A7 but prolongs D-region (Bb7 later on)
  - Bmaj7 is technically a VL thing, but can still be seen as prep of Bbmaj7

** DONE Pent Up House [OK]

** TODO Sweet Georgia Bright [OK,?]                                 :discuss:

- improvement: second Bb7 does not go to Eb7 but to final C7
- constituents: should the 2nd Bb7 belong to the first part?

** DONE Valse Hot [OK]

** DONE Wayne's Thang [OK]

** DONE We will meet again [OK]

** TODO Blue Bossa [OK,?]                                           :discuss:

- disagree: bII is a subdominant!!!

** DONE Israel [OK]

** DONE Mac the Knife [OK]

** TODO Sugar [?]                                              :constituents:

- why start doing I-V stuff here but not elsewhere?
  - doesn't make sense for 1st 4 bars -> G7 is more turnaround than HC
  - maybe different for 2nd 4 bars

** TODO When the saints go marching in [?]                     :constituents:

- constituents inconsistent
  - why not I-V for complete first half?
  - why resolved to the first I in 2nd part, not last?

** TODO Work song                                              :constituents:

- fine except for I-V

** TODO Beatrice

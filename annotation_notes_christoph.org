- improvement: Dm7 - Fm7 as double prep
  - Dm7 prepares G7 -> subst by Bb7 -> prepared again by Fm7
- disagree: Bb7 - E7 is interruption, Bb7 is global D, E7 is applied
  - either double prep of C (from Bb7 and G7)
  - or prol Bb7 G7
- alternative: G7 (and possibly Bb7) prepare final Cmaj7
  - C7 is applied to F, but otherwise detached
  - reason: G7 sounds like global dominant, should prepare global tonic
    - G7 C7 is nice surface trick, but more like interruption
